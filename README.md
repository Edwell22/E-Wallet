# **Overview**  

As a software engineer, I developed an **E-Wallet System** in **C#** to enhance my understanding of **file handling, user authentication, and financial transactions**. This software provides users with a **secure digital wallet** that supports **registration, login, balance checking, deposits, withdrawals, and both internal and external transfers**.  

## **Purpose of the Software**  
This project was created to demonstrate **C# fundamentals**, including:  
âœ… **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** â€“ Using **classes and objects**  
âœ… **File-Based Data Storage** â€“ Managing users without a database  
âœ… **Error Handling & Input Validation** â€“ Preventing crashes with `TryParse()` and `try-catch` blocks  
âœ… **User Authentication** â€“ Ensuring secure login with stored credentials

# **Future Work**  

Several improvements can be made to enhance the functionality and security of this E-Wallet System:  

- ðŸ”¹ **Implement Password Hashing** for better security (e.g., SHA-256 encryption).  
- ðŸ”¹ **Introduce a Graphical UI** using Windows Forms or .NET MAUI for a better user experience.  
- ðŸ”¹ **Enhance Transaction Logs** to track user history with timestamps.  
- ðŸ”¹ **Expand External Transfers** to simulate real-world banking transactions.  
- ðŸ”¹ **Add Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** to improve account security.
